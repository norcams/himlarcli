Dear user,

NREC is increasing in popularity and we are encountering challenges in
keeping up with the high demand, as our resources are limited.  As a result, we
see that we need to implement a policy change in the near future for demo
projects, which includes automatic termination of long running instances, in
order to meet the requirements of standard projects.

We have yet to determine when this will take effect and how long a demo period
will be. For now, we ask you to consider whether your running demo instances
are being actively used and to take note of this upcoming policy change. You
will, of course, be notified again when the details have been determined.

You have the following instances present in your demo project:

$project:

$instances

Standard projects are not affected by this policy. You may apply for a standard
project at:

https://request.nrec.no

We do not currently charge for standard projects and requests are being granted
by the NREC team based on available resources. However, this may be subject
to change in the future.

For more information, please read our terms of service:

Kind regards,

The NREC team
