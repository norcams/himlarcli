Dear user,

On September 11 the University of Oslo will change the mail attributes for all
users in its catalog services. The email address exported to Feide will change
from the user's primary email address to a new shortened format which will
affect multiple services using it for authentication, like NREC. You will
receive a new email with all changes to your resources on September 11.

The new username in NREC will be: <uio-username>@uio.no
Demo and private project names will be changed accordingly.

More information from UiO (in Norwegian):
https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/aktuelt/planlagte-tjenesteavbrudd/2019/2019-09-11-feide-weblogin-mail-attributt.html

Consequences and action needed on your part:
- This does not affect login to the dashboard, but note that project names have
  changed as described above
- If you're using the Openstack command line or any automation tools like
  Terraform, you will have to manually update your configuration (e.g.
  keystonerc or openrc) to reflect these changes.

Best regards,

NREC
