Dear user,

As previously announced, the University of Oslo changed the mail attributes for
all users in its catalog services on September 11 affecting multiple services
using Feide for authentication, which includes NREC. Consequently, we've
renamed UiO users and projects to conform to this new shortened standard.

Please note that this does not affect dashboard login, however, if
you're using the Openstack command line or any automation tools like Terraform,
you will have to manually update your configuration (e.g. keystonerc or openrc)
to reflect these changes:
$changes
Best regards,

NREC
