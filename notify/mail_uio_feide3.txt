Dear user,

Last week we updated the username and project name of all UiO users to conform
to the new shortened email standard used for Feide logins etc. As an unforeseen
consequence, UiO users' key pairs disappeared from the NREC dashboard and,
unfortunately, we are unable to restore them.

This does NOT mean that you've lost access to your instances, nor does it affect
any key pairs created via the API (Terraform, Openstack CLI etc.). It does
however mean that it will not show up on the list of available key pairs when
creating a new instance in the NREC dashboard.

The only action needed on your part is to re-add any key pairs you want to use
for future instances. If you've created the key pair in the dashboard and only
have the private key stored locally, we've created a short guide on how to
regenerate the public key here:

Please get in touch with us if you have any questions:

Best regards,

The NREC team
