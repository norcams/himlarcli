Hi,

Due to scheduled maintenance, running vGPU instances in NREC will
experience downtime on $date.

Affected instance(s) connected to your email $admin

$instances

After the maintenance window you will need to update the instance vGPU
driver. More information here:

  https://docs.nrec.no/vgpu.html#upgrading-the-instance-drivers

Instances running on vGPU hosts will experience downtime when the
compute host is down for maintenance. Please note that, there can be
scheduled maintenance on the second Tuesday of every month.

If you have unused vGPU instances, we would also appreciate if you
delete them. Resources are limited!

Support and contact information can be found at
