Hi,

The email address $email associated with your UH-IaaS account is no longer
your primary email address in your organization. As a result, your account has
been deactivated and the instances in your demo and/or personal projects have
thus been stopped. The account and all resources associated with it will be
terminated in 30 days unless you notify us before then.

If you have changed your email address or think this is an error please contact us
and we will help you getting access to your project(s) and instances again.

Support and contact information can be found at http://docs.uh-iaas.no/en/latest/support.html

Best regards,
The UH-IaaS team
