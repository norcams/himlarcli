Dear user,

On February 18, we'll be changing the name of the NREC service to
NREC (Norwegian Research and Education Cloud).

IMPORTANT: There will be a small interruption in the service on Tuesday 18
February between 14:00 and 15:00 when we will deploy the necessary changes to
our configuration. Running instances will not be affected by this.

There will be no changes to the service apart from the name itself and
the associated domain. The only action required on your part is to change
your configuration files to our new endpoints - simply replace
uh-iaas.no with nrec.no There's no urgency as we will keep the old
domain for a while, but we recommend that you do it as soon as possible.

Why are we doing this?

We wanted a more informative and coherent name - easier to pronounce and
easier to remember - which clarifies who and what the service is
intended for. Along with the name change, we're also getting a brand new
look, a new logo and, perhaps most importantly for our current users, a
new domain name.

NREC will be run by the same team and remain exactly as it is today.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at support.nrec.no or
our Slack channel.

Kind regards,

The NREC team
