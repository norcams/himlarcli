Dear user,

As NREC is increasing in popularity, we've been forced to reallocate our
resources from the obsolete "legacy" availability zones (AZ) to the current
default ones running centralized storage. By doing this, we will greatly
improve performance and stability for our users.

Consequently, we need to terminate the following of your instances currently
present in the legacy AZ in $region:

$instances

The termination will be performed on $date followed by the removal
of the $region_lower-legacy-1 AZ. You are free to start new instances in the
$region_lower-default-1 AZ.

If you still need your old instances, we recommend that you create snapshots of
them and use these snapshots to create new instances. Please see
http://docs.nrec.no/create-snapshot.html for a walkthrough on how
to do this.

Further documentation and contact information can be found at
http://docs.nrec.no

We apologize for the inconvenience. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you
have any questions or concerns.

Kind regards,

NREC team
