Dear user,

We have now terminated all instances in the legacy AZ in VAGRANT. Please
refer to prior communication for the reasoning behind this.

All instances have been backed up to snapshots which can later be used to
recreate them in a valid AZ.

The list below shows your terminated instances and their respective snapshot
names:

$instances

Further documentation and contact information can be found at

We apologize for the inconvenience. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you
have any questions.

Kind regards,

NREC team
