Hi,

An HPC project named $project_name has been created.
Admin user is $admin. End date is $end_date.

It is important to note that the HPC service is in a beta stage. The stability
of the service may be lacking compared to the standard UH-IaaS services. Things
such as flavors and policies may change.

Please read the end user documentation at

http://docs.uh-iaas.no/en/latest/hpc.html

before you start using the service.

If you have any questions or problems using the service, please let us know.

Best regards,

The UH-IaaS team
