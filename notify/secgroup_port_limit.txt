Dear NREC user,

During our periodic sanity check of security groups, we have
discovered a problem with a security group rule in one of your
projects:

  Region: $region
  Project: $project_name (ID: $project_id)
  Security Group: "$secgroup_name" (ID: $secgroup_id)

Security group rule details:

  Rule ID: $rule_id
  IP version: $rule_ethertype
  Ports: $rule_ports
  Protocol: $rule_protocol
  Remote IP prefix: $rule_remote_ip_prefix

In our view, this rule opens up too many ports to too many
hosts. Please consider either limiting the number of ports, and/or the
number of hosts for which the ports are opened.

The purpose of this message is only to bring this to your attention,
you may fix this problem at your discretion. If this problem persists,
we will issue a new notification in $notification_interval days.
